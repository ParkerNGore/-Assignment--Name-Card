Where in your HTML did you link to your JavaScript file? Are there better places? What's the best place? 
I linked it below the body. I would think the best place to put it is at the top of the document near where you link the CSS file.

Why is it best practice to store your CSS/JS in external files rather than in your HTML file? 
To make code easier to read and you can find it quickly.
